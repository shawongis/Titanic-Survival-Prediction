# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
A Machine Learning Project
The sinking of the Titanic ship caused the death of about thousands of passengers and crew is one of the fatal accidents in history. The loss of lives was mostly caused due to the shortage of the life boats. The mind shaking observation came out from the incident is that some people were more sustainable to endure than many others, like children, women were the one who got the more priority to be rescued. The main objective of the algorithm is to firstly find predictable or previously unknown data by implementing exploratory data analytics on the available training data and then apply different machine learning models and classifiers to complete the analysis. This will predict which people are more likely to survive. After this the result of applying machine learning algorithm is analyzed on the basis of performance and accuracy.
